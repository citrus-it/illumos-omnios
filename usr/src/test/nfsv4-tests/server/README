nfsv4-test/server/README:
=========================================================

This directory consists of the following:

mk_srvdir.sh:
script to create test files/directories in the current
directory based on variables in v4test.cfg file, which
must be found in the same directory as the script. In
nfsv4-test environment path used for mk_srvdir.sh is
$BASEDIR variable. See top-level README file for details. 

v4test.cfg:
Consists of the types of test files/directories to be
created on the server by mk_srvdir.sh script.

Purpose:

This is intentionally separate to allow server files to be
installed in server systems which maybe outside the testing
environment, e.g. outside firewall; and the tests can still
be executed if NFS traffic is allowed between the client
and the server.
