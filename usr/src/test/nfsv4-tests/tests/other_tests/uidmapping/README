This directory consists of uidmapping tests.

To run all assertions, just follow nfsv4-test suite convention and use the 
following command:

	./runtests

To run specific assertions, use the following command:
	
	TESTLIST=<test_file> ASSERTIONS="<assertion_name> ..." ./runtests

For example, to run uidmapping_pos03{a}, uidmapping_pos03{b}, and 
uidmapping_pos03{c}, use the following command:

	 TESTLIST=uidmapping_pos03 ASSERTIONS="a b c" ./runtests

The above feature(running specific assertions) is provided mainly for debugging
purpose, so we implement it in a simple way, and don't check user input for 
wrong test file name or wrong assertion names. 

Please note that, in nfsh scripts(that is, uidmapping_neg01, uidmapping_neg02,
uidmapping_pos01), assertion is not implemented as a function. It needs 
a bit more work to support running specific assertion in these scripts than 
it is worth. So we decided not to implement that until necessary.
