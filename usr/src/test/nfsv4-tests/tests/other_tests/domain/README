This sub-suite consists of tests for testing rules to get the domain for
NFSv4 NFSMAPID.

1. How to Run Assertions
========================

To run all assertions, just follow nfsv4-test suite convention and use the 
following command:

    ./runtests

To run specific assertions, use the following command:
	
    TESTLIST=<test_file> ASSERTIONS="<assertion_name> ..." ./runtests

Example 1: the following command runs nfsmapid01{a}

    TESTLIST=nfsmapid01 ASSERTIONS="a" ./runtests

Example 2: the following command runs libmapid01{a}, libmapid01{b}, and 
libmapid01{c}

    TESTLIST=libmapid01 ASSERTIONS="a b c" ./runtests

Some assertions have dependencies among them. These assertions have the 
same name, but with a different numeric character appended to it, for 
example, nfsmapid01{d1} and nfsmapid01{d1}. To run these assertions, you
need to remove the numeric postfix:

Example 3: the following command runs nfsmapid01{d1} and nfsmapid02{d2}

    TESTLIST=nfsmapid01 ASSERTIONS="d" ./runtests


2. nfscfg_domain_tmout
======================

nfsmapid(1M) has a nfscfg_domain_tmout variable to control how long the 
daemon thread waits before it checks domain configuration changes. Its value
is 300 seconds by default. 

Using that default value, it takes more than 1 hour to run all tests. So, 
to make them run faster, the value is changed to 10 seconds during the test.

User can customize this value with DOMAIN_TMOUT env variable, in the 
following way:

    DOMAIN_TMOUT=60 ./runtests

Please note the above method only works in global zone and whole root zone.
The reason is we do that by using mdb to modify nfsmapid(1M) binary file.
In sparse root zone, however, the file is on a file system shared with
read-only option, so the value of nfscfg_domain_tmout variable can't be 
changed.

So it takes much longer(more than 1 hour) to run all tests in sparse root zone.
