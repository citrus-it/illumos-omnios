This sub-suite consists of tests for Access Control Lists (ACL) 
attributes in NFSv4.

See http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3530.txt section 5.11 Page 50. 

The tests are divided into three basic groups: 
o acl_neg* 	- negative tests to ensure server responds correctly
	     	  to invalid and unsupported ACL requests.

o acl_pos* 	- postive file tests

o acl_dir_pos*	- positive directory tests (including file and 
		  sub-directory ACL inheritance)
