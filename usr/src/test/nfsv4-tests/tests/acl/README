This sub-suite consists of tests for NFSv4 ACL attributes.
See http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3530.txt

Currently there are two subdirs for the ACL tests:
	- srv_tests
		The tests in this subdir use the "nfsv4shell" TCL tool. 
		See http://nfsv4shell.sourceforge.net/ for more information 
		about this tool and the "nfsh.man" document with comes 
		with the tool for the usage.
	- cmd_tests
		The tests in this subdir mainly verify ACL attributes
		using getfacl(1) and setfacl(1) commands.

Please refer to the README files under the subdirs for more information.
