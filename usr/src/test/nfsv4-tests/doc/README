Overview
--------

This "nfsv4" is a general test framework consists of different tests for 
testing NFSv4 server and client.  Test sub-directories include :

	acl		   - access control list tests
	basic_ops 	   - server tests of basic operations for RFC3530
	num_attrs	   - number attribute tests
	named_attr	   - named attribute tests
	other_tests	   - uidmapping and I18N 
	recovery	   - client recovery and server unshare tests
	srv_namespc	   - server namespace tests

The tests under these subdirs are written in different programming languages, 
including C, Shell(s) and TCL that uses "nfsv4sh" tool.  Makefiles are 
provided to build and install the executables to the "proto" directory or
package for execution.  Scripts are also included for automation of setup
and cleanup.


Requirements
------------

The following requirements must be met before running the tests:

 1) Require minimum of two systems, a localhost and a remote host.  Both
    systems under test must be able to 'rsh' to each other as root.

 2) Must be "root" to run the setup and cleanup and the recovery tests.

 3) Define the following required environment variables.  For those
    that are optional, if not set, the default value will be used:

	setenv SERVER remote_host_w/NFSv4_available 		(required)
		No default for this variable
	setenv LOGDIR the_result_logs_directory			(optional)
		default is /var/tmp/nfsv4-test/results
	setenv DNS_SERVER a_DNS_server_accessed_by_all_systems	(optional)
		default is jurassic.eng.sun.com

 4) TCL (Tools Command Language, tcl8.5), must be available or
    installed in the localhost before building and running the tests.

 5) If run on opensolaris, please make sure the SUNWhea (SunOS Header Files)
    package is installed or the related headers are available on the server,
    otherwise, the uidmapping_stress01 test will fail.


Other setup (optional)
----------------------

There are several test filesystems required for testing.  The tests
currently support two types of filesystem, one is ZFS, the other is UFS.

By default, tests itself will detect automatically the filesystem type of
BASEDIR on SERVER.
If filesystem type is ZFS, tests will run over ZFS;
If filesystem type is UFS, tests will run over UFS;
Otherwise, tests will print error message and exit. 
	setenv BASEDIR a_base_testing_directory_in_server	(optional)
		default is /NFSv4Test

If SERVER is zfs boot, and you also want to run the tests over UFS,
you must provide a dir based on UFS and define BASEDIR as the following:
	setenv BASEDIR your_ufs_dir_in_server

Similarly, if SERVER is ufs boot, and you also want to run the tests over ZFS,
you must provide a dir based on ZFS and define BASEDIR as the following:
	setenv BASEDIR your_zfs_dir_in_server

If tests would be run over UFS, by default they will be setup using LOFI (but
NOTE that the LOFI setup will be lost if you reboot the SERVER). If you prefer
not to use LOFI setup, but to supply your own real filesystems, you must provide
the following filesystems and UFS mount them to the correct directory names.
	BASEDIR the base testing directory, default is /NFSv4Test
	PUBTDIR to $BASEDIR/PublicFS, e.g. /NFSv4Test/PublicFS
	ROOTDIR to $BASEDIR/RootFS, e.g. /NFSv4Test/RootFS
	ROFSDIR to $BASEDIR/RoFS, e.g. /NFSv4Test/RoFS
	NSPCDIR to $BASEDIR/NoSPC_FS, e.g. /NFSv4Test/NoSPC_FS
		(where NSPCDIR must be a small filesystem, e.g. 3MB)
	KRB5DIR to $BASEDIR/KRB5C_FS, e.g. /NFSv4Test/KRB5C_FS
	SSPCDIR to $BASEDIR/SRVsp_FS, e.g. /NFSv4Test/SRVsp_FS
	SSPCDIR2 to $SSPCDIR/hide/SRVsp_d2
		e.g. /NFSv4Test/SRVsp_FS/hide/SRVsp_d2
	SSPCDIR3 to $SSPCDIR2/hide2/SRVsp_d3
		e.g. /NFSv4Test/SRVsp_FS/hide/SRVsp_d2/hide2/SRVsp_d3

Tests may fail unexpectedly if these test filesystems are not pre-setup
correctly when not using LOFI.  

Sometimes during the recovery tests the server is not visible on the network
for several minutes after the server has rebooted. This causes some of the
tests that are intended to run in the grace period to fail. The solution to
this problem is to add an /etc/defaultrouter file to the server.

If your server takes a long time to reboot, e.g. a SunFire machine that has
lots of memory/disk, you may want to set the following variable a bigger value
(in seconds):
	setenv REBOOTIMER 1800				(optional)
		default is 480

Note: the recovery tests will reboot the server.  It may ask for fsck
	during the rebboot due to the LOFI setup.  Hence, it may help 
	to turn on logging (via /etc/vfstab) of the filesystem that 
	the BASEDIR, e.g. /NFSv4Test, is set to before running the tests.

Note: This test suite now uses sharectl(1M) to change/reset the NFS properties,
	which would restart the corresponding services. Any transient (or
	temporary) exported filesystems in the test systems shared prior to the
	test run would get lost/unshared. If these shares in the test systems
	need to be available after running the suite, make sure they are shared
	permanently, e.g. use sharemgr(1M) "share -p" to share the filesystems.

IPv6 support
------------
   The test suite has IPv6 support turned on by default.  If your client and
   server supports NFS over IPv6 and you want to run the tests over the IPv6
   connection, please make sure the SERVER variable is set to the valid name
   for IPv6 and set the following variable before running the tests:
	setenv TRANSPORT tcp6
		default is tcp

Trusted Extensions over a CIPSO connection
------------------------------------------
   In order to successfully test NFS in Trusted Extensions over a CIPSO
   connection, the NFS server MUST be configured with at least two IP
   addresses, one of which is allocated solely for use by the global zone.
   The following variable must also be defined:

        setenv ZONE_PATH /zone/<zone name>                         (required)

            where:
                  /zone directory is where the non-global zone
                  paths reside.

     example:
        setenv ZONE_PATH /zone/public

        This would produce the resultant MNTPTR default of:
                /zone/public/NFS4_Mnt
        And would produce the resultant BASEDIR default of:
                /zone/public/NFSv4Test
        And would produce the resultant QUOTADIR variable to contain:
                /zone/public/root/NFSv4Test/QUOTA_FS

   NOTE:
        For the NFS client, there is no need to allocate a unique IP to
        the global zone; the entire system can be configured to have just
        a single all-zones IP address.

        The default for ZONE_PATH is NULL.


A journal file of the test results will be created for each subdir, along 
with a Summary file containing condensed test status under $LOGDIR directory.
These Summary files can be compared against the baseline results.

The nfsv4shell/nfsh/nfsh.man manpage details the usage of each NFSv4 
operation in the nfsv4shell, which is used for most of the tests in 
the basic_ops subdir, and a few tests in other subdirs as well.
