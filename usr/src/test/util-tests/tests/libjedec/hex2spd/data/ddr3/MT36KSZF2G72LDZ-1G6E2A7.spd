# Note: In the online SPD data the CRC was claimed to be CC3C (what the
# order of bytes is is not clear); however, we calculated a different
# CRC and other CRC calculators agree with us based on this data. Given
# that the CRC algorithm is the same across the other specifications and
# we generally match that data, for now we believe that this was
# incorrect and instead have written the calculated CRC in here.
