# This is a 100% made up LPDDR5X CAMM2 part. LPDDR5 CAMM2 is a dual
# channel device with each channel made up of 16-bit subchannels,
# meaning a total of 8 sub-channels (4/channel). We will be making up a
# fake 1Rx16 device that supplies 16 GiB through 4 LPDDR5 components
# which each provide a 16 Gbit die (each die has two sub-channels so it
# sums up to 32 Gbit). This is similar to the example in JESD406-5.
#
# From an addressing perspective we have this in 8 bank mode. 6 columns
# are required and 16 rows.
#
# In addition, there are a few components a CAMM2 is supposed to have:
# a PMIC5200 and a JESD300-5 1024 byte SPD hub with thermal sensor.
#
# Timing parameters are a mishmash of different parts of the LPDDR5X
# base spec with variants tossed on to test FTB calculations.
