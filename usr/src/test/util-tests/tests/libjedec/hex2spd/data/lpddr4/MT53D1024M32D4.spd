# Micron MT53D1024M32D4 faked up SPD data. LPDDR4/X parts generally have
# no distinct SPD data and instead someone enters the timing parameters
# manually into a system memory controller. As such, we manually went
# through the datasheet for this and tried to make up SPD data that
# seemed useful enough and exercise our parsing code.
#
# The following times were taken across Table 112: Refresh Requirement
# Parameters, Table 197: Core Timing Parameters, and related. We used
# this at the speed 4267 Mt/s with the 16 Gb density devices. The MTB is
# 125ps and the FTB is 1ps. While the datasheet takes the basic LPDDR4
# 100ns value for tCKAVG_max, that doesn't fit in the actual value.
# Instead we use the SPD spec's approximate value 0xc just to have
# something that fits. We were unable to find a tAA value so it was just
# set to 0x23 arbitrarily.
