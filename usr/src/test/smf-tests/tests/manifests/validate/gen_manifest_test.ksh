# DESCRIPTION :
#	Generate a list of manifests and services that a validation
#	can be run against to check for errors, and warnings.
#	Any warning or failure from manifests on the system will
#	need to be noted.
#	While not really a testable noting of services without
#	manifests and vice versa will be made as well as the
#	counts of service/manifests.  This will be so that stored
#	test logs can be reviewed against newer test logs for
#	changes.
#
# STRATEGY :
#	A manifest must be un-modified from the base install of
#	that manifest.  
#
#	- Get a list of all the services on the system
#	- Get a list of all the manifests in the MANIFESTPATH
#	- Associate each manifest with a service and add to the
#		test list in the form of :
#			manifest:service
#	- For each service left over add to the test list in the
#		form of :
#			:service
#	- For each manifest left over add to the test list in the
#		form of :
#			manifest:
#
#	- for each entry in the test list validate each of the
#		entries and report anomolies, in the manifest
#		and/or the service.
#
#	- for the single manifest or service entries make note
#		of these for additional reference.

#
# Get the list of manifesets and associate them with a known
# service, removing the service from the service list, and
# adding the manfiest:service to the test list
#
# For any manifest that doesn't map to a know service just add
# the manifest to the test list for just manifest validation.
