All tests in this directory verify NFSv4 RECOVERY

RECOVERY test does not support SETUP=none, all recovery
tests will NOT run and return UNSUPPORTED.

Some tests in recovery will test conflicting lock, original scenario is
start processes on different machine (such as CLIENT and CLIENT2). In
order to max-utilize resource, we use different process on the same machine.
For best testing, it's better to make each process access a different
mountpoint. User can set below two optional env virables for this purpose,
there are:
	MNTDIR2	-- mount the $SHRDIR to this directory, default to
		   $MNTDIR  
	MNTOPT2 -- mount options when mount $SHRDIR to $MNTDIR2, default
                   to $MNTOPT
