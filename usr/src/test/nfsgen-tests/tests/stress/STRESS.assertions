st_0001:
-------
	a test user open()s and write()s a file (size defined
	as a parameter) then read()s it back to verify content
	and delete it.

	st_0001 -T 10 -Q 30 -I 10 -u 0.1 -f ${MNTDIR}/$$.st_0001 -d 1


st_0002:
-------
	Open a large number of files. Writes some bytes (with size
	defined as an option), closes the files, waits some time and
	reopens the files checks their content and deletes them.
	Optionally, write locks and spawns a child that attempts
	to access file.
	
	st_0002 -u 0.1 -b ${MNTDIR} -n 128 -W 12 -d 1


st_0003:
-------
  a)	Open a large enumber of files. Acquire a write lock then
	fork a child that hammers to get a write lock, in the
	meantime  parent sleeps, wakes up releases the initial
	write lock and waits for the child to exit.

	st_0003 -S 1 -b ${MNTDIR} -n 128 -W 30 -d 1


st_0003:
-------
   b)	Open a large number of files read donly, close and open write
	only, close and then open read only finally close and
	unlink.

	st_0003 -S 2 -b ${MNTDIR} -n 512 -d 1


st_0003:
-------
   c)	Open a large number of files, acquire write lock then unlink
	file _without_ a close.

	st_0003 -S 4 -b ${MNTDIR} -n 512 -d 1

st_0003:
-------
   d)	Open a large number of files read/write, read_lock the entire
	file, write_lock the first and last 1024 bytes, release the
	1st read_lock, get a write_lock on thte rest of the file
	(middle bit) unlock everythihng and delete file.

	st_0003 -S 3 -b ${NFStestDir} -n 512 -d 1

	NOTE: Solaris doesn't support the negative seek with fcntl(2) for NFS;
	so this assertion is now commented out.


st_0004:
-------
	Spawn N processes, each process traverses a directory tree
	and stats each file.


st_0005:
-------
	sit in a loop mounting, readdir and unmounting a file system
