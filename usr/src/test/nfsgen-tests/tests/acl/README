All tests under in this directory it to verify NFSv4 ACL,
There are two subdirs: 
  - trivial is to verify file/dir tools work well for acl.
  - nontrivial is to verify NFSv4 ACL

The exported filesystem on server side should be ZFS. 
e.g. when SETUP variable is set to nfsv4, the user
should set SHRDIR variable to a directory based on ZFS. 
Otherwise, all acl tests won't run.

When SETUP is set to none, the user should create the 
following groups and users on all test machines, and set
them to corresponding variables.

- One test groups
	ACL_STAFF_GROUP

- Two test users in ACL_STAFF_GROUP group:
	ACL_STAFF1, ACL_STAFF2

- One test user in root group:
	ACL_ADMIN

In addition, the exported filesystem on the server should
be shared with the option "anon=0" or "root=client_name"
