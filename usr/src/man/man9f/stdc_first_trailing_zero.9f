.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn stdc_first_trailing_zero
family of functions returns the 1s-based index of the first zero bit in
.Fa value
starting at the least significant bit.
If there is no zero bit in
.Fa value
then zero is returned.
.Pp
The
.Fn stdc_first_trailing_zero
function is generic and will operate on all 8, 16, 32, and 64-bit
unsigned integers; however, it is only available in C23.
The other functions all operate on a specific integer type, but
otherwise behave the same and are available regardless of the C language
version.
.Sh CONTEXT
These functions may be called from
.Sy user ,
.Sy kernel ,
or
.Sy interrupt
context.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The functions in the
.Fn stdc_first_trailing_zero
family always return the index of the first trailing
zero bit in
.Fa value
plus one.
Otherwise, if there are no zero bits in
.Fa value ,
0 will be returned.
These functions cannot fail.
