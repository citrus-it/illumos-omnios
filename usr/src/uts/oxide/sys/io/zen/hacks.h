 * We'd like to open the GPIO driver and do this properly, but we need to

 * function to do it for us directly.  GPIO hacks. This is used to release PERST
 * during the LISM on Ethanol-X, Ruby, etc (but not Gimlet or Cosmo, which uses
 *ÃŸ the GPIO expanders for PERST) and to signal register capture for PCIe
 * debugging via a logic analyzer.  The CONFIGURE op claims the GPIO via the
 * IOMUX and configures it as an output with internal pulls disabled.  We allow
 * setup of only those pins we know can/should be used by this code; others will
 * panic.  The other operations are all straightforward and will work on any
 * GPIO that has been configured, whether by us, by firmware, or at power-on
 * reset.  If the mux has not been configured, this will still work but there
 * will be no visible effect outside the processor.
 *
 * We use MMIO here to accommodate broken firmware that blocks SMN access to
 * these blocks.
