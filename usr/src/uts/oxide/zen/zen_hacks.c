/*
 * It is an unfortunate reality that the reset and shutdown conditions of an
 * x86 microprocessor are ill-defined and dependent upon implicit interactions
 * between many different components:  the core inducing the shutdown or
 * reset, the other cores on the die, the hidden computer that is effectively
 * contained within that die (euphemistically called a system-on-a-chip), the
 * lowest level software running on each those components, and the surrounding
 * machine itself (replete with its own historical artifacts).  Each of these
 * is poorly documented and strictly proprietary; it is no surprise that their
 * confluence works by accident such as it works at all.  In short, it is a
 * midden pit of computing:  interesting, perhaps, to future anthropoligists
 * -- but consisting only of refuse, it was never designed at all, let alone
 *  to serve as foundation.
 *
 * The problem in front of us -- ludicrous as it may seem -- is to make sure
 * that a core shutdown properly induces a machine reset (that is, we wish
 * to transition the machine from A0 to A2).
 *
 * The first issue is even more basic:  assuring that a single core shutdown
 * in fact shuts down all cores.  (Amazingly, this is not the default
 * disposition, and a single core shutdown will just result in a chunk of the
 * system silently disappearing, with the rest of the system left to discover
 * its absence only through the prescribed work that it is apparently no
 * longer doing.)
 *
 * Experimentation has revealed that this issue can be resolved by setting
 * en_shutdown_msg in FCH::PM::ACPICONFIG: when this bit is set, a shutdown on
 * a single core results in a SHUTDOWN message being sent in such a way that
 * all cores shutdown.  This is important, but it is insufficent: the shutdown
 * message will result in all cores entering the shutdown state, but there
 * isn't further activity (that is, there is no reset, externally visible or
 * otherwise).
 *
 * Fortunately, there is an additional register, FCH::PM::PCICONTROL that has
 * a shutdownoption field; this is defined to "Generate Pci (sic) reset when
 * receiving shutdown message." The type of reset is itself not defined, but
 * it has been empirically determined that setting this bit does result in a
 * shutdown message inducing behavior consistent with a Warm Reset.
 * (Specifically: we see RESET_L become de-asserted for ~60 milliseconds while
 * PWROK remains asserted.) Note that the CPU itself appears to go back to ABL
 * under this condition, and retrains DIMMs, etc.
 *
 * Importantly, the SoC resets under this condition, but the FCH is not reset.
 * Specifically, FCH::PM::S5_RESET_STATUS does correctly reflect the reset
 * reason (namely, shutdown_msg is set). On the one hand, this is helpful in
 * that it gives us a potential backstop, but on the other hand it is chilling:
 * if there were any lingering doubts that the state of the system is too
 * ill-defined after a reset to depend on, this should eliminate them!
 *
 * Finally: setting rsttocpupwrgden in FCH::PM::RESETCONTROL1 results in what
 * appears to be closer to a cold reset, in that in addition to RESET_L being
 * asserted, PWROK is also de-asserted (for ~6 milliseconds).
 *
 * The below code takes these three actions, and together with modifications
 * to the boarder system to detect any change in RESET_L/PWROK, assures that
 * a single core shutdown (e.g., due to a triple fault) results in our
 * desired semantics:  a machine reset through A2.
