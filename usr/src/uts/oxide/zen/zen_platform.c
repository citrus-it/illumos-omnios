/*
 * Provides convenient accessors for ops vectors and so forth from the Oxide
 * platform definition.  Generally, client code in the Oxide architecture is
 * expected to invoke a wrapper function which calls these, as opposed to
 * accessing the ops vectors directly.  Thus, these are used only in the
 * implementation of those wrappers.
 *
 * Ideally, none of these would be necessary, and we'd simply plumb these
 * through as arguments where needed (or we'd just pass the `zen_platform_t`
 * around and dereference from there), but empirically this has been seen to be
 * a bit unwieldy.
