# Configuration variables for the runtime environment of the nightly
# build script and other tools for construction and packaging of
# releases.
# This example is suitable for building an illumos workspace, which
# will contain the resulting archives. It is based off the onnv
# release. It sets NIGHTLY_OPTIONS to make nightly do:
#       DEBUG build instead of non-DEBUG (-D)
#       runs 'make check' (-C)
#       checks for new interfaces in libraries (-A)
#       sends mail on completion (-m and the MAILTO variable)
#       creates packages for PIT/RE (-p)
#       checks for changes in ELF runpaths (-r)
#
# - This file is sourced by "bldenv.sh" and "nightly.sh" and should not 
#   be executed directly.
# - This script is only interpreted by ksh93 and explicitly allows the
#   use of ksh93 language extensions.
