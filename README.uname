This tree has the changes to implement an illumos-specific uname.

Specifically, uname -s will return "illumos", and uname -r will return
0.9.x (where x is an integer number of months since August 2010.)

This is likely to cause some challenges.

You can override the value back to legacy for a process and its children
with puname(1). In this case it will revert to SunOS 5.11.  This is a
workaround until software is updated.  Fix the software if you can.

  BUSTED THINGS
#################

* lint - checks for Solaris 7 or newer
  - lint defined to use $(SETALTUNAME)

* cc (CC?) - checks for Solaris 7 or newer when building 64-bit
  - the libc symbols test suite checks this and handles it
  - the cw program is left alone, we use gcc and don't shadow compile
  - use puname(1) with make or nightly if this causes too much grief

* pkgdepend - vendor-packages/terminatorlib/cwd.py
  - usr/src/pkg/Makefile edited so pkgdepend uses $(SETALTUNAME). (see #61)
  - error is at /usr/lib/python2.6/vendor-packages/terminatorlib/cwd.py

* hald - hald sets HAL_UNAME_S, and fails if it doesn't recognize it (SunOS)
  - this causes an apparent hang in X
  - hald will be ejected from this repo in the future (see #60)

* DTrace test suite - printf/tst.str.d
  - this is just a known answer test that expects sysname to be SunOS
  - leaving this unfixed for now - not a runtime problem (see #62)
