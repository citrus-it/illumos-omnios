Features
========

This file documents feature changes at a very high level.

A '-' means that the support for that feature was removed, a '+' means that
the support for that feature was added, and a '*' means that the behavior
was changed.

<next> release
--------------
 - ksh93 (/sbin/sh, /bin/ksh93, /bin/rksh93) and related libraries (libast,
   libcmd, libdll, libpp, libshell, libsum) are no more.
 - nonstandard getgrent_r, fgetgrent_r removed from libc
 - wordexp & wordfree removed from libc
 - sgtty.h removed, including stty() and gtty()
 - nightly.sh is no more; see README.md for updated build instructions
 * removed posix.1c draft versions, and made default the standard versions, of
   the libc functions getgrgid_r, getgrnam_r, ttyname_r, getlogin_r
 * removed non-posix versions of the libc functions shmdt, sigwait,
   gethostname, putmsg, putpmsg, getaddrinfo
 + _XOPEN_SOURCE=700 and __EXTENSIONS__ are defined by default, if not
   specified. most third-party software already uses these on Solarises in an
   attempt to get a somewhat sane compilation environment
 + all applications automatically use 64-bit files. using the LFS/"large file"
   interfaces _LARGEFILE_SOURCE, _LARGEFILE64_SOURCE and _FILE_OFFSET_BITS is
   no longer necessary.
 + various improvements have been made to shorten the build time.
 + the installer user interface has been simplified considerably.

1.2 release
-----------
 - libfruraw, libnvfru, libfru, libfrureg, libfruutils
 - libpicl, libpicltree, picld(8), etc.

 * ship openbsd ksh as /bin/sh (/bin/ksh93, /bin/rksh93, and /sbin/sh remain
   ksh93)
 * convert BREAD/BWRITE/BWRITE2/GETBLK macros to bread/bwrite/bwrite2/getblk
   static inlines

   comm, cut, join, kill, logname, paste, rev, sleep, tee, test, uniq, wc
 * autofs is disabled by default
