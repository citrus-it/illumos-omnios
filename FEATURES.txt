 * man(1) is mandoc. mandoc.db support added, eliminating the need for
   manpage symlinks.
 * socket interfaces are now in libc. libsocket, libxnet and libnsl remain as
   filter libraries.
 * socket implementation was modified to be more reasonable by default, and it
   is no longer possible to choose an alternate socket implementation.
   msg_accrights was removed and msg_control members are now always visible in
   struct msghdr.
   Documentation was updated and moved to section 2: accept(2), bind(2),
   connect(2), getpeername(2), getsockname(2), getsockopt(2), listen(2),
   recv(2), send(2), shutdown(2), socket(2), socketpair(2), and the new
   sockatmark(2) and CMSG_DATA(3)
 * make(1) is bmake(1) instead of dmake(1)
 * sed(1) replaced with a version imported from FreeBSD
 * locale data has been updated to CLDR v28; tools to generate it were imported
   from FreeBSD. This fixes many character classification errors.
 * install(1m) was replaced by install(1) from OpenBSD.
 * all process security flags are on by default
 * putwchar(3c), putwc(3c), fputwc(3c), and fputws(3c) have only XPG5 behavior
 * man pages from section 1M have been moved to section 8; third party code
   (libncurses, namely) is not affected
